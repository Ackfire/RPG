# RPG project :desktop_computer:

## Done by Melissa, Maxime and Romain - Epitech 2022 :mortar_board:

This project is a part of the **first** year of Epitech. <br>
We had **1 month** to complete it. :spiral_calendar: <br>

The goal of this project is create a **RPG game** in **C** with the **CSFML library**. :video_game:<br>

To try this program, you need to use this **command**: <br>

```bash
make && ./my_rpg && make fclean
```

An output you can get from this program can be:
